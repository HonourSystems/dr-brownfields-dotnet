swap has a bug where it won't swap the last card

Discard has a bug where discarding the highest index is allowed and will throw an exceptoin.

Ranking calculation should be accurate, but is highly contingent on their being 5 cards.

	- Test a shuffle without changing design.

Enumeration breaking when multiple payouts are the same.
